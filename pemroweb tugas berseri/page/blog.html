                <h4 class="paragraph-title">What is Devin and what it does</h4>
                <p>As per Cognition, Devin is a tireless, skilled teammate, equally ready to build alongside you or independently complete tasks for you to review. With Devin, engineers can focus on more interesting problems and engineering teams can strive for more ambitious goals.<br>Devin can plan and execute complex engineering tasks requiring thousands of decisions. It can recall relevant context at every step, learn over time, and fix mistakes.</p>

                <h4 class="paragraph-title">How will Devin impact software jobs?</h4>
                <p>Software programming was getting impacted with generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot, but Cognition’s Devin has taken this to another level, Jaspreet Bindra, MD & founder of The Tech Whisperer, has told TOI. “It has seemingly groundbreaking capabilities in transforming software development. It can handle some development projects independently, from writing code to fixing bugs and executing tasks, therefore mimicking a full-fledged AI worker rather than just a coding assistant,” he said.</p>

                <p>ChatGPT is actually a chatbot. It is a powerful tool that can help you with tasks such as composing emails, essays, and code. Maybe ChatGPT will be your best friend in the future.<br>This model was originally developed based on the GPT-3.5 model and is specially trained for chatting. With the release of GPT-4, ChatGPT started using this model.<br>While this dialog robot used to only accept text input, it now accepts visual inputs as well. For example, when you draw a website model and give it to ChatGPT, this model gives you the necessary codes to build it for the site.</p>

                <h4 class="paragraph-title">What you can do with Chat-GPT</h4>
                <p>Good. Now, let’s look at the usage scenarios.<br>ChatGPT can writimg us a summary of the book. Of course, it’s better to read the whole book. But if you don’t have the time, this is one way to get an idea of the book. Thus, by looking at this summary, you can decide whether to spend time on the book.<br>, ChatGPT started recommending books within seconds. It is writing not only the names of the books but also the features of the books.</p>

            <h2 class="header">‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — To the Hashira Training’ Review: Monster Mash-Up</h2>
            <h4 class="author"></h4>
            <p>“Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — To the Hashira Training,” from the director Haruo Sotozaki and the Japanese animation studio Ufotable, isn’t actually a movie: It’s a feature-length presentation of two episodes from the popular “Demon Slayer” television series, neatly spliced together but otherwise unchanged in the transition to the big screen.<br>It’s the second such theatrical special, after last year’s “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — To the Swordsmith Village,” which combined the ending of the show’s second season with the premiere of the third. “To the Hashira Training” jams together the third-season finale and the fourth-season premiere, both of which are a little under an hour long; the fourth season hasn’t aired on TV yet. As you might imagine, the movie is meant for fans.</p>
